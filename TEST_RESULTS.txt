- Support designation

All field officers with these designations can now use the complete
check-in → check-out flow with proper validation, GPS capture,
workplace selection, and travel integration.

NEXT STEPS:
==========
1. Deploy the enhanced template (mark_attendance_enhanced.html)
2. Set up the auto-update cron job (auto_update_attendance.py)
3. Train users on the new check-in/check-out process
4. Monitor the system for any issues during initial rollout
